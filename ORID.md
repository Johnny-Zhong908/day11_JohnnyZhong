Objective
During this learning process, I was exposed to front-end interceptors, CORS, and cross domain access between front-end and back-end. Subsequently, I also started to learn about Cloud Native related knowledge.
Reflection
Compared to previous studies, this experience was smoother and there were not many obstacles. I feel that my understanding and acceptance of these technologies have improved.
Interpretive
This may be related to previous learning accumulation, as the cognitive foundation of front-end and back-end knowledge is more solid. At the same time, the content of the study progressed from shallow to deep, with a clear structure, which helped me better grasp the relevant concepts.
Decision making
In the future, we will continue to consolidate our knowledge of Cloud Native and delve into its combined application with cross domain access. Plan to better practice these technologies and enhance overall capabilities.
